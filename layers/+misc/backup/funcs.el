  "Make sure emacs backs up buffers on every save, not just the first time.

By default, emacs backups the file only first time it is saved:

> Emacs makes a backup for a file only the first time the file is
> saved from a buffer. No matter how many times you subsequently
> save the file, its backup remains unchanged. However, if you
> kill the buffer and then visit the file again, a new backup
> file will be made.

This function, if installed as a before-save-hook, extends that
behavior to save a backup copy each time a file is
saved (per-save backup). It also preserves the first-time only
behavior (per-session backup).

per-save and per-session backups are stored in different
directories.

  ;; Make "per session" backup at the first save of each emacs session.
  (when (not buffer-backed-up)
    ;; Override the default parameters for per-session backups as we don't need
    ;; to keep as many copies.
    (let ((backup-directory-alist `(("" . ,backup-per-session-directory)))
          (kept-new-versions 3))
      (backup-buffer)))
  ;; Make a "per save" backup on each save. The first save results in both a
  ;; per-session and a per-save backup, to keep the numbering of per-save
  ;; backups consistent.

    (backup-buffer)))
